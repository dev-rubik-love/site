                <span>Rubik-Love</span> is a totally new platform to find co-thinkers
                driven by a private unique algorithm.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span>The algorithm</span> is the heart of the platform.<br>
                He's analyzing user behavior and producing exact math value.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span>The math value</span> exactly describing on how

                <br>
                <br>
                <span>The set of math values</span> allows building the grid around the user

            <h2>QA</h2>

            <p>
                <span>- Who is yor target audience?</span><br>
                - Our target audience combined (consist?*) of:
                1. People who want to get result with no limited quantity-quality point.<br>
                ... *?
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>- What is characteristics of your target audience?</span><br>
                1. People of any age<br>
                ...?
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>- What your target audience similar to?</span><br>
                We are interested to people who are now using:<br>
                1. "Tinder" dating service for dating<br>
                2. "LinkedIn" social network for business goals<br>
                3. "Facebook" universal social network for chat<br>
                4. Users of Tik-Tok for a new trends<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>- Why not to integrate our algorithm into these platforms?</span><br>
                This is possible, and we want to provide a such service in the future,
                but for now it has a few problems:<br>
                1. It may lead to big legality issues from any of these platforms,
                   we are not so giant and probably will get a bad contracts.<br>
                2. It's technically harder and requires more resources in both aspects, launching and maintenance.
                   Start our platform is easiest for now. <br>
                3. We're splitting our audience in many difference pieces, it's already not a single place.
                   (It's converting us from B2C to B2B.?*)<br>
                4. We are not so giant or familiar for now. It will a tons of resources to proof that we are need to be integrated.
                   It's more productive to get a some value first.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>- Why we are ultimately better</span><br> than all other dating services?
                Other dating services able to provide result with only strictly limited quantity-quality point.
                We can produce result with any quantity-quality point.

            </p>


            <p>
                <span>- Why need one more dating service?</span><br>
                -Current sites of dating are not working. This is proven by their quantity and sameness.
                If at least 1 of them worked, he would fill the entire niche.
                This is reminiscent of the abundance of forums before the coming of social networks.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>- Are we "Tinder" or same to it?</span><br>
                - No. We are in a sense anti-tinder.<br>
                Tinder puts outer looks first.<br>
                We put the inner world first.<br>
                We are the same in our goal to connect the people.<br>
                We are totally different in our way to do it.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>- Are we "LinkedIn" or same to it?</span><br>
                <br>
                - No, "LinkedIn" misses all valuable meta-information of the user, <br>
                he knows nothing about a user mindset.<br>
                It can tell you is someone experienced enough, <br>
                but it never will not answer is you looking the same.<br>

            </p>

            <p>
                <span>- Why don't dating services work?</span><br>
                - They are based on a total contradiction. The dating site has to get the client for X money
                and get from him 2X money. AT the moment when the client gets what he wants,
                finds a friend, soul mate or a partner, he's leaving the platform.
                The service will never to lose a client who pays, the client will never to get what he are findings for.
            </p>

                <span>- Why people wants one more dating service?</span><br>
                - Current dating services are not working.<br>
                This is proven by their quantity and sameness.
                If at least 1 of them worked, he would fill the entire niche.
                This is reminiscent of the abundance of forums before the coming of social networks.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>- Why we are reminiscent to google?</span><br>
                We have the similar algorithm, google meet for sites, we meet for people.<br>
                The very base and very first google algorithm was doing the next:<br>
                Other search engines ("Yahoo", "AltaVista", etc) was giving result by count of target words on the site page.<br>
                Google starts to give result by count of target links. Goog sites has more links that leads to them.<br>
                Other "Search people engines" giving result by count of target words in the user biography.<br>
                Rubik starts to give result by count of target posts. Goog matching people has more matched posts that leads only to them.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>- How did you solve the contradiction</span> of "X and 2X" of dating services?<br>
                - Three points:
                <br>
                <br>
                1. <span>We combined dating service and social network.</span>
                Now if user will get what he wants, let's say the soul-mate - he is still interesting in two other
                goals: find a new friends, find a new partners. Because of these 3 things consist our life.
                Soul-mate, friends, partners. At least two of them we always wants to find new.
                <br>
                <br>
                2. <span>If user will leave the platform</span> - he will miss a quality of his personal grid.
                Because the quality of grid increase every day. Missed days can't be restored.
                Moreover, every day has his own exclusive value for every user.
                The wish to get rarely personal exclusive value will attract user at least open the platform once a day.
                <br>
                <br>
                3. <span>We can control</span> how fast user will find a new friends, partners, soul-mate.
                Because getting too many friends, partners or soul-mates
                will decrease the valuable of these important things in the life.
                <!-- Eventually, we are trading a people, in the good sense of these words,
                and we are interested to support a high cost of person and his features-->
                We are appreciate and loving these things and will try to balance between quality and quantity.
                This flow becomes endless just like a life of man.
                friends and build the personal grid around itself. Every person always interesting in
                We know how to remain regular customers even after X's point of view when he finds
                partner. We stretched the process, smoothed out sharp corners, and made it endless.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>- How the algorithm works?</span>
                <br>
                - We send posts that come to all users. Users rate these posts by “like” or “dislike”.
                We track these ratings and find people who have given the same rating to the same post.
                At first time the accuracy is low, but already after a week every user will have 2^28 combinations.
                It's making every user a really unique.
                With every new rate, a group matches narrows down literally to a one person,
                and the accuracy proportionally grows to almost 100%, It's like a Google algorithm but for people.
                Simple enough to be lightweight and scalable, efficient enough to be first in market
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>- Почему тогда у них есть клиенты?</span>
                <br>
                Мы видим только вершину айсберга, это 20%, которые подстроились под сервисы знакомств. Основная
                аудитория игнорирует
                сервисы знакомств в текущей реализации. Мы проводили опрос и он показал, что 50% считают регистрацию и
                использование
                сайта знакомств постыдным занятием, ещ 30% прекратило их использование по ряду причин (скудный
                функционал, отсутствие
                результат, фиктивные пользователи и т.п.), оставшиеся 20% пользуются ими за неимением лучшего.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>- Используете ли вы искусственный интеллект?</span>
                <br>
                - В настоящий момент нет, но мы планируем. Текущих задач так много, что на искусственный интеллект
                просто не остается
                ресурса. Однако если у нас будет специалист, мы дадим старт этой области. Это агрегирует уже имеющиеся
                плюсы с
                развивающимися современными тенденциями.

                <br>
                Each new like to a post increases the accuracy,
                the posts is published daily, the accuracy increases every day, this is endless process.

            <p>

                <br>
                In a regular service, if you just list your hobbies - there will be many "misses".
                User 1 wrote "rollers", and user 2 "roller skates", and that's it, no match will happen.
                User 1 wrote "ping-pong" and user 2 wrote "table tennis" - it's the same, but match will be missed.
                With musical groups, such situations are especially.
                Moreover, many films, games, gods, have different name in each country for marketing purposes.

                Imagine you met a "Jean", he will provide friends, partners, soul-mates for you but you should type

                something?
                Did it? Now, are you sure your soul-mate also did it? Unique, but not alone.

                <br>

                At least 50%, 10%, 5% of this time? Is result accessible at all?
                The time you spent in the past does not affect the future result in any way.
                In our case, this is not the case, the accuracy increases with each put "like".
                All limited only by your desire.

                Do you want a soul-mate that will share your mind exactly the 20% or 80% percentage?
                It's manageable!
                Any number from 0 to 100, any count of matches, mismatches,
                Every user has his own "perfect match" coefficient.
                The system may control every number by providing the corresponding matches.
