            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                <span>Rubik-Love</span> is a totally new platform to find co-thinkers
                driven by a private unique algorithm.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span>The algorithm</span> is the heart of the platform.<br>
                He's analyzing user behavior and producing exact math value.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span>The math value</span> exactly describing on how
                <br>the mindset of one user matches with another.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span>The set of math values</span> allows building the grid around the user
                <br>of what things and people he is interested in.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span>The set of grids</span> allows binding a comprehensive global grid
                <br>from every user to every user, just like atoms bound in the universe ...
                <br>
                <br>
                <span>Now we are ready</span> to provide an entirely new quality<br>
                of matching and people connection in the world of social networks and dating.
            </p>
        </div>
        <!-- How it works and why -->
        <div id="qa" class="main-text main-block section">
            <h2>QA</h2>

            <p>
                <span>- Who is your target audience?</span><br>
                We are interesting to people who are now using:<br>
                1. "Tinder" dating service for dating<br>
                2. "LinkedIn" social network for business goals<br>
                3. "Facebook" universal social network for chat<br>
                4. Users of Tik-Tok for new trends<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>- Why not integrate our algorithm into these platforms?</span><br>
                This is possible, and we will do it in the future, but for now, it has a few problems:<br>
                1. It may cause legal issues without a correct contract with the platform.<br>
                2. It requires more resources in both aspects, launching, and maintenance.
                Starting our own platform is the easiest for now.<br>
                3. For now, we are not so giant and popular. The integration will take a lot of resources
                to prove to a platform that we need to be integrated.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>- Why we are ultimately better</span> than all other dating services?<br>
                Other dating services able to provide result with only strictly limited quantity-quality point.
                We can produce result with any quantity-quality point.
            </p>

            <p>
                <!--<span>(- Why current dating services are not working?*)</span>-->
                <span>- Why people wants one more dating service?</span><br>
                - Current sites of dating are not working. Their quantity and sameness prove this.
                If at least 1 of them worked, he would fill the entire niche.
                This is reminiscent of the abundance of forums before the coming of social networks like "facebook".
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>- Why do dating services not works?</span><br>
                - They are based on a total contradiction.
                The dating service has to get the client for X money and get from him 2X money.
                At the moment when the client gets what he wants, he will leave the platform.
                The service will never lose a client who pays, and the client will never get what he is looking for.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>- How did you solve the contradiction</span> of "X and 2X" of dating services?<br>
                - We combined dating service and social network.
                Now if user will get what he wants, soulmate for example,
                he is still interested in two other things: friends and partners.
                Because of these 3 things consist our life.<br>
                User always interested in quality and quantity of his soulmate, friends and partners.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>- Why do dating services still have customers?</span><br>
                Because people want to date despite the clumsy of current dating services.<br>
                We see only the tip of the iceberg. This is the 20% that have adjusted to them.
                The main audience ignores dating services in the current implementation.<br>
                We conducted a survey, and it showed that 50% consider registering
                and using a dating site as a shameful activity,
                and another 30% stopped using them for a number of reasons:
                poor functionality, lack of results, fictitious users, etc.
                The remaining 20% use them for lack of a better one.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>- Are we "Tinder" or same to it?</span><br>
                - No. We are an anti-tinder in some sense.<br>
                Tinder puts outer looks first.<br>
                We put the inner world first.<br>
                We are the same in our goal to connect people.<br>
                We are totally different in our way of doing that.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>- Are we "LinkedIn" or similar to it?</span><br>
                - No, "LinkedIn" is missing all the valuable meta-information about the user.<br>
                It knows nothing about the user's mindset.<br>
                He can tell you that someone is experienced enough<br>
                but he will never answer whether you are looking for the same thing.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>- Are you exactly</span> a social network or dating service?<br>
                - Exactly, 50/50!<br>
                We are the service that can connect people by their mindset.
                What we can do with it is a secondary question.
                <!--We can archive both these goals with it.-->
                We will analyze the user behavior to answer this question more precisely in the future.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>- Why do you, at times, call yourself a social network or dating service?</span><br>
                - Like 20 years ago, there is no special word/term, for now, to describe what we're doing.
                I'm using the word that is more suitable for a special concrete case.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>- Your goals and usage so indeterminate? </span>
                You've mentioned business network, social network, dating service and content making,
                is it not too many goals?<br>
                - Flexibility rather than indetermination. We can win in each of these spheres because our algorithm
                gives us key advantages in each of these areas.<br>
                No need to use experience if you can use math.<br>
                It's different spheres only in terms of humans.<br>
                In the words of the algorithm, it's still the same task - sort the users.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>- You are so flexible, which sphere will you deal with first?</span><br>
                - According to our initial customer development, the best audience for us is the dating sphere.<br>
                - We will do research for the next stages in the next rounds.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>- How the algorithm works?</span><br>
                - We send posts that come to all users.<br>
                Users rate these posts with "like" or "dislike".<br>
                We track these ratings and find people who have given the same rating to the same post.<br>
                At first time, the accuracy is low, but already after a week, every user may have > 2^28
                combinations.<br>
                It's making every user unique.
                With every new like, a group matches narrows down literally to a single person,
                and the accuracy proportionally grows to almost 100% - <br>
                - Simple enough to be lightweight and scalable, efficient enough to be first in the market.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>- How to use the future app?</span><br>
                1. Like the posts what you are liking.<br>
                2. Open the result tab with people that has similar mindset with you (or vice versa, the different).<br>
                3. Explore and choose users that looks cool for you.<br>
                4. 4. Enjoy! Now you can easily start to chat with them based on the common interests<br>
            </p>


            <p>
                <span>- Why you're looking for an investor </span>if you have not 100% finished your technical side?<br>
                - Perfectionism is good in theory and bad in practice, we are the practical one.
                We are already useful to users, and they are waiting for us.
            </p>

            <p>
                <!--                TODO 4 possible application-->
                <span>- What risks does an investor have with us?</span><br>
                - We need 6 employees for 6 months to finally prove our concept and get the first 10 000 users.<br>
                Definitely, 6 months is a risk, but let's imagine the worst case.<br>
                Even if we fail every, at least 4, applications of the algorithm, after 6 months, we are still getting the following:
                1. We will have a product that can be sold, integrated, or scaled.
                2. The 6 months of advantage (фора / отрыв) for the future trend of people sorting.
                3. Ready-to-use developers team that can deal with any technical product.
                4. Ready-to-use programming code base for similar products.
                5. Experience in a new, not researched set of approaches to solving the popular problem.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>- Why do we resemble google?</span><br>
                We have a similar algorithm. Google is used to search for sites, and we are searching for people.<br>
                The most basic and very first Google algorithm did the following:<br>
                Other search engines ("Yahoo", "AltaVista", etc.) returned results
                based on the number of target words on the site page.<br>
                Google started to show results based on the number of targeted links.<br>
                Good sites have more links leading to them. We are doing the same.<br>
                Other "Search people engines" give results by the count of target words in the user profile.<br>
                Rubik starts to give results based on the count of target posts.<br>
                Good-matching people have more matched posts that lead only to them.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>- Why do we resemble asymmetric cryptography encryption?</span><br>
                - The heart of asymmetric encryption is the idea that we can't do something to be 100% endless
                in the universe, but we are doing it so long that it's 100% enough for our whole life.<br>
                We have used the same idea. The dating services paradox of X and 2X can't be solved endlessly for 100%,
                but we are doing that for so long that enough for the whole human life.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>- Is the best audience already collected</span> by "Tinder" ?<br>
                <!--                (the cheapest and payment able)-->
                - Quality over Quantity. Tinder collects people under the motto "quickly".<br>
                We gather people under the motto "Quality".<br>
                Which of these audiences brings more profit is an open question. But we still have one advantage:<br>
                We can downgrade to the motto "quickly".<br>
                "Tinder" is unable to upgrade to the motto "quality".
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>- Are you using artificial intelligence (AI)</span>,
                neural network (NN), machine learning (ML), etc.?<br>
                <!--Currently not.--> No, our algorithm is better for our goal.
                More precise results, lower costs and ease to scale.
                Each of these technologies has good and bad application.
                One of the good application is to invent a new approach by noticing the unique features.
                We have already invented a new approach and know how to sort and match people.
                The final stage in every AI/NN/ML development is a transformation of expensive technology into a small,
                scalable algorithm, just like us.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>- Are you planning to use artificial intelligence (AI) in the future?</span><br>
                - Yes. We are never missing the good practices.<br>
                We will combine and experiment on our algorithm with AI/NN/ML in the future stages.<br>
                Despite the fact that we invented the algorithm - we are still entering
                into a totally new unexplored area. Our algorithm is not only a final solution for matchmaking
                but also a door into a new world of another-level possibilities.

            <h2>Our key advantages</h2>

            <p>
                <span>Profile autofill.</span><br>
                - Filling out the profile is the most painful problem of such services,
                both for the users and for the platforms.
                Platforms need a minimal set of information about users to provide quality service,
                and users are not ready to spend much time on profile filling.
                Eventually, platforms are losing money, and users are missing quality service.
                We autofill the user profile on the results of the algorithm job.
            </p>

            <p>
                <!--Helps to make the first step-->
                <span>Touchpoint.</span><br>
                In other social networks people can't start the communication comfortable<br>
                Touchpoint. In other social networks, people can't start communication comfortably
                because they do not know the touchpoint of each other.
                Social networks with uncomfortable communication miss a lot of benefits.<br>
                - Our algorithm calculates the touchpoint for a user and shows the result.
                Now two totally unknown users can comfortably start communication without fearing being ignored.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>Safe and effective chat.</span><br>
                - Safe chat is an important metric for every social network.
                Some dating services even position safe chat as their key advantage.<br>
                In our service, it's only one of the key advantages.<br>
                Here it's safe because a user can choose a boundary of mindset matching before starting the
                communication.<br>
                It's effective because users can skip standard tedious questions
                and immediately start speaking about hobbies of each other.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>Your hobbies are exact.</span><br>
                In a regular service, if you just list your hobbies - there will be many "misses".
                User 1 wrote "rollers", and user 2 "roller skates", and that is, no match will happen.
                User 1 wrote "ping-pong," and user 2 wrote "table tennis" - it's the same, but the match will be missed.
                Moreover, many films, games, and gods have different names in each country for marketing purposes,
                it's making standard match system useless.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>Result guaranteed.</span><br>
                How much time do you need to spend on a dating site to achieve a guaranteed result?
                At least 50%, 10%, or 5% of this time?
                In other services, the time you spent in the past does not affect the future result in any way.
                In our case, the accuracy increases with each put "like".
                500 likes are enough to get high-quality matches. The ultimate quality is limited only by your desire.
            </p>

                <span>Helps people to research itself</span><br>
                <!--            - Human mindset is subtle thing. -->
                - The person's mind is a mystery, even for the person himself.
                Exploring it is one of the biggest humanity questions.
                We will help users to research themselves with a set of our features.
                Likes provided by a user allow building a grid of his hobbies, preferences, etc.
                Dataanalise will reveal dependencies that, for now, are hidden from humanity.

                <span>Controlled outcome.</span><br>
                Do you want a soulmate that will share your mind exactly the 20% or 80% percentage?It's manageable!<br>
                Any number from 0 to 100, any count of matches and mismatches.<br>
                Each user may choose his own "perfect match" coefficient,
                and the service will provide the corresponding matches.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>Instantaneous descriptive information about the user.</span><br>
                Let's imagine you met a new friend and want to know more about him.<br>
                You no more need to ask boring questions to each other about what you love or not.<br>
                Just share your profile! He will give a lot of key information.
                It's not only the primary information about the age, business, location and etc.
                It's first of all a fast information about music, films, hobbies, politic, point of view and etc.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>Fast result.</span><br>
                This advantage may not be desirable for product evolution, but experience the power of the algorithm.<br>
                One minute - this is how much time a user needs per day to get a high-quality result.<br>
                This time is enough to open the site or application, put the "likes"
                and get the result whenever you want.<br>
                The algorithm will do all the stuff for you.

            <span>Data provided itself by user itself</span><br>
            The result and accuracy of the service are highly tied to data provided by the user itself.<br>
            It's a lot of exact relevant data from the users.<br>
            "A lot" because the more the user puts likes - the more accurate result he will get.<br>
            "Exact" because the quality of matches depends on a user's likes.
            There is no sense for a user to mislead about his preferences.<br>
            "Relevant" because the relevance of matches depends on the relevance of the likes.<br>
            In total, about the data:<br>
            1. Provided directly by the user. No need to spend resources to collect it.<br>
            2. Exact, without missing or broken pieces. No need to think out and guess.<br>
            3. Manageable source - posts are provided by the platform,
            and we can decide the kinds of posts that will be published to get likes.<br>
            4. The same source. We can make continuous analyze.<br>
            5. The same data model for analyzing from multiple sources.
            It can be combined and analyzed from multiple sources.<br>
