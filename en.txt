MAKE MANY (25) STAGES

IDEAS:
1. Likes for system (to sort people by view, or etc)
2. Profile is also a card
3. Person is set of cards (it can be used as representation even for users)
4. Self-made cards to user for profile personalization
5. Make filter (in %) to start the chat
6.


THE QUESTIONS:
1. Main content is people or cards (interests) ?
2. Motiv is swipes or content ?


MOTES:
1. Like - swipe - chat
2. Don't use experience when you can use the math.


The problem for auditory:
1. Problem for auditory (not enough quality of match algorithm)

The solution:
1. Are we can meet the demand, provide enough solution (a good match quality).
2. Two persons should become more closely step by step, it can't be immediately.



Hypotheses and metrics:
1. CSAT
2. NPS
3. DAU (daily active users)
4. MAU (mouth active users)
5. WAU (week active users)
6. Group speed of users num
7. Check the algorithm quality by some metric (by miss swipes) ?




The ultimate:
1. people along the whole world. There are 7 000 000 000 people that we can split.
2. We can not solve the problem, but we definitely worst to check us and our algorithm.
3. "Zacepka" - the point to start chat/date.
4. Flexibility over abstraction (neponimanie)
5. No any communication action may have enough quality without this algorithm (kadri reshaut vse).


MISCELLANEOUS:
1. Why most of dating apps has no good filters
2.


AXIOMS:
1. Algorithm is required part of our dating app.


QA:

New: Our vision of success


A note about terms and tech side:
In words of terms, dating service and social network are interchangeable.
Any dating service has option to find friends rather than a partner.
Any social network may serve to dating goal.
Practically, dating service is special case of social network with concrete goal.


Monetization:
Personal data of user preferences (posts that he's liking?*), got directly from him,
giving us a great abilities for monetization.

Paid personal functionality.
Target ads based on algorithm result.
Subscription to extended options,
Personal ads by markets.


Ability 1:
Paid personal functionality.
Broad set of functionality allows us data
Some special sorts (cases?*) requires more calculation and has the highest cost.
It's honest to get back money from the user for it.
For example: The user want to get people in backward order (from lowest to highest mindset correspondence).
It's demands additional calculations and will be provided as paid functionality.

Example of paid functionality:
1. Backward order of result (people comes from lowest to highest mindset correspondence).
2. Posts creation. Posts made by service editor, but user may buy ability to create self posts.
3. User defined match range. People will get matches only in set range, 40%-60%, > 90% or any other ranges.
4. Get specialized set of people that may be interested to user, made by extended set of analytic tools.

Example of personal and target ad:
1. Post with a good that similar to already liked good by a user.
2. Post from well known brands. It may be "Dior" perfume or "Domino's" pizza.
3. Post wil local places or events. It may be a new opened restaurant or rock concert.


Subscription with extended options.
This is profit model of most dating services.
Examples of personal and target ad:
1. Post with a good that similar to already liked good by a user.
2. Post from well known brands. It may be "Dior" perfume or "Domino's" pizza.
3. Post wil local places or events. It may be a new opened restaurant or rock concert.
4. Post with a user that want to become more popular (That approach (model ?*) similar to regular dating services).


Every action from this list requiring extended calculation.
(Moreover, we can set any price for additional calculation to a users like "Amazon" does it ?*)
It's only a functions that we are already predicts.



We can provide a flex profit model:

How we behave:
We're taking existing model of social networks / dating services and breaking a great contradiction.

- Why current dating services don't meet the demand?
- The heart of a regular dating service is total contradiction.
He has to get the client for X money and get from him 2X money.
At the moment when the client gets what he wants, finds a friend, soul mate or a partner, he's leaving the platform.
The service will never to lose a client who pays, the client will never to get what he is findings for.
We are solved this fundamental contradiction (here link)


ADDED:

3.
(- Why current dating services are not working?*)
- Why people wants one more dating service?
- Current dating services are not working. This is proven by their quantity and sameness.
If at least 1 of them worked, he would fill the entire niche.
This is reminiscent of the abundance of forums before the coming of social networks.


- Who is yor target audience?

- Our target audience is people who want to get result with another point between quantity and quality.
(
- people who want to get matches and connections, proved by some metric.
- people who want to get matches and connections, proved by some metric.
- people who want to get matches and connections with some metric proof
- people who want to get not so trash matches and connections as it exists now.
There are point between)


- Why we are ultimately better than all other dating services?
Other dating services able to provide result with only strictly limited quantity-quality point.
We can produce result with any quantity-quality point.


----------------
FIRST APP WITH NO NEED TO THINK WHAT TO WRITE TO ANOTHER USE
----------------
SALE THE ALGORITHM?
----------------
SPLIT "1000" FOR ABS STRATEGY TESTS
----------------
SHORT METRIC OF USERS GROW UP QUANTITY.

USER BEHAVIOR HYPOTHESES:
1. Like cards - swipe users - chat
2. Swipe users - Like cards - Chat
